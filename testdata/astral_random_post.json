Also:</p><p><strong>1: </strong>In my post on the precision of sensory evidence, I cited a finding that depressed people had impaired color vision, ie literally saw the world in shades of gray. An alert reader sends me <a href=\"https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1778/v1\">a paper that discredits </a>one of the main results in that field. I’m not going to completely retract the claim, because there are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322310001290\">other non-discredited papers</a> showing the same thing, and the discredited one just showed people a sad movie rather than using real depressed people. But I appreciate the reminder that this is still controversial and needs further research.</p><p><strong>2: </strong>ACX’s unofficial fan bulletin board, Data Secrets Lox, announced the results of their recent Best Post competition. First place was Evan on <a href=\"https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2346.msg66205.html#msg66205\">Tax prep volunteering as a window into society</a>. Second was <a href=\"https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2409.msg68515.html#msg68515\">Bean on whaling and fishing vessels</a>. Third was <a href=\"https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2496.msg71580.html#msg71580\">David W on chemical plant design</a>.

If that’s you, you can send it again and I’ll mention it on the next Open Thread, sorry.</p>",
