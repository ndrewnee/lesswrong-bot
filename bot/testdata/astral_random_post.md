This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about whatever you want. Also:

**1:** In my post on the precision of sensory evidence, I cited a finding that depressed people had impaired color vision, ie literally saw the world in shades of gray. An alert reader sends me [a paper that discredits](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1778/v1) one of the main results in that field. I’m not going to completely retract the claim, because there are [other non-discredited papers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322310001290) showing the same thing, and the discredited one just showed people a sad movie rather than using real depressed people. But I appreciate the reminder that this is still controversial and needs further research.
