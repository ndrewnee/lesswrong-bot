The news of today is that AstraZeneca is halting their vaccine trial in South Africa after data showing that it is ineffective against the B.1.351 variant. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/south-africa-suspends-use-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-after-it-fails-clearly-stop\n\nGiven the country's reliance on that vaccine, it is very bad news. There may be some protection against disease severity but lack of protection against infection is not encouraging.\n\nIn other news, apparently the J&J vaccine won't receive FDA authorization until at least March.
