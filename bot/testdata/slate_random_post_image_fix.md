On Less Wrong, Bucky [tries to replicate](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uZEeqmeFjs3nmawn7/age-gaps-and-birth-order-failed-reproduction-of-results) my results on birth order and age gaps.

Backing up: two years ago, I looked at SSC survey data and found that [firstborn children were very overrepresented](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/). That result was replicated a few times, both in the SSC sample and in other samples of high-opennness STEM types. Last year, I expanded those results to look at how [age gaps](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/) affected birth order effects. Curiously, age gaps less than seven years did not seem to attenuate birth order, but age gaps of more than seven years attenuated it almost completely.

Bucky analyzed the same data and found that I bungled one and a half of my results. Left graph in each pair is mine, right is Bucky‚Äôs.

In the first analysis, Bucky replicates my results: in people with exactly one sibling show a sudden cliff in birth order effects after seven years.

In the second and third analysis, Bucky finds that I screwed up. I mislabeled the second analysis (people with more than one sibling) as the third (full sample), and my third analysis was just wrong (I double-counted people with one sibling).

When Bucky corrects these errors, they find that the weird cliff at seven years is present only in the sample of people with exactly one sibling. This makes it more likely to be a weird coincidence about that sample, and less likely to be a weird phenomenon. They also identify a potential confounder (there may be longer gaps between later-born children than between first-borns and second-borns) which also slightly affects the results, although does not dramatically change the conclusions.
