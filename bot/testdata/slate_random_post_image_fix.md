📝 [[Partial Retraction] Age Gaps and Birth Order Effects](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/09/partial-retraction-age-and-birth-order-effects/)

On Less Wrong, Bucky [tries to replicate](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uZEeqmeFjs3nmawn7/age-gaps-and-birth-order-failed-reproduction-of-results) my results on birth order and age gaps.

Backing up: two years ago, I looked at SSC survey data and found that [firstborn children were very overrepresented](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/). That result was replicated a few times, both in the SSC sample and in other samples of high-opennness STEM types. Last year, I expanded those results to look at how [age gaps](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/) affected birth order effects. Curiously, age gaps less than seven years did not seem to attenuate birth order, but age gaps of more than seven years attenuated it almost completely.
